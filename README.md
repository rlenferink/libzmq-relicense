# libzmq relicense

Due to the request for relicensing libzmq, the following template is available.
An example is included to correctly fill and name this template.

This template should be filled and then included in the RELICENSE folder of the libzmq 
github repository as `{{name}}.md`. A pull request is necessary for including this file to the original libzmq repository.
